            <button class="accordion_button">What is Carwhile?</button>
            <div class="accordion_panel">
              <p>Carwhile is an on-demand washing, detailing and maintenance concierge service based in Washington, D.C.  We come pick up your car, get it serviced and return it to you so that you don’t have to.</p>

            <button class="accordion_button">Why use Carwhile?</button>

              <p>In short: to get a hassle-free service experience that fits your busy schedule. If you want to have a clean and well-maintained car but can’t (or just don’t want to) waste your time driving to and waiting at a car wash, service center or dealership, Carwhile will take care of it for you.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion_button">How does it work?</button>
            <div class="accordion_panel">
              <p>After scheduling service through our website, you will be contacted via text message or phone call (whichever you prefer) 15 minutes before your appointment time to arrange the pick-up of your vehicle.  An insured and vetted Carwhile driver will arrive to retrieve the keys from you and then will take your car to be serviced.  After the service is complete, you will be contacted again via text message or phone call to arrange the drop-off of your vehicle. Your vehicle will then be delivered to where it was picked up or to a different location of your choosing, whichever is more convenient.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion_button">What services do you offer?</button>
